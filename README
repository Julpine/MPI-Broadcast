How to run the program:

mpirun -np p ./test x y z

p = number of processes

3 command-line inputs (Must be integers):

x = program number
	1 - Runs broadcast_p0_pow2()
	2 - Runs broadcast_pow2()
	3 - Runs broadcast()

y = Value stored in Root

z = Root to store Value
	Root is always 0 for program #1

Example:

mpirun -np 8 ./test 3 4 5

Program = 3
Value = 4
Root = 5
